# quantize.py

"""
This script provides a basic implementation for quantizing a given model to 16-bit precision.

The `QuantizeModel` class takes an input model and applies 16-bit quantization.
Feel free to modify this template to suit your specific quantization requirements.
Additionally, `QuantizationAwareTraining` class is provided to perform Quantization Aware Training (QAT) for 8-bit quantization.
